\subsection{Interim Evaluation of the Hypotheses and Formal Framework}

Having established the experimental architecture and its accompanying mathematical formalism, we may now assess the status of the hypotheses introduced thus far. Rather than presenting these hypotheses as isolated propositions, they form an interconnected explanatory sequence: each articulates a different dimension of the same underlying phenomenon—the deformation of the evaluative pathway through which moral salience becomes behaviour.

The first hypothesis, the \textit{Evaluative Deformation Hypothesis}, posits that the expected outcome of moral behaviour—formalised as the transformation \(f\) of perceptual–moral cues—changes when a humanoid robot is added to the environment. This is the empirical backbone of the inquiry. The observed attenuation in donation behaviour across conditions is consistent with this expectation. Accordingly, this hypothesis is \textbf{retained} as an operative empirical claim.

The second hypothesis, the \textit{Synthetic Normativity of Moral Displacement}, gives conceptual depth to this empirical deformation. It claims that synthetic entities may acquire \textit{normative affordances} by virtue of their perceived ontology, even in the absence of sentience or interaction. This hypothesis is not behaviourally testable in a strict sense; its role is philosophical and structural. It explains why a silent, non-interactive robot can nonetheless exert normative influence on human evaluative cognition. It remains \textbf{retained} as a conceptual grounding for the empirical findings.

The third hypothesis, the \textit{Synthetic Perturbation of Moral Inference}, specifies the mechanism underlying H1. It suggests that the robot refracts the evaluative transition from moral salience to prosocial action, acting not as a social partner but as a perturbative operator within the cognitive ecology. The behavioural attenuation observed in the Robot condition accords with this mechanistic interpretation. Thus, this hypothesis is also \textbf{retained} and will guide the subsequent modelling of trait–context interactions.

The conjunction of these three hypotheses forms a coherent interpretive arc: H1 isolates the empirical signature of deformation; H2 explains its ontological possibility; H3 articulates the inferential pathway through which such deformation is instantiated. No hypothesis introduced thus far is contradicted by the current evidence, and no revision is warranted at this stage.

\subsubsection*{Status of the Mathematical Formalism}

The mathematical apparatus introduced earlier has likewise played a substantive role in structuring both the empirical reasoning and the interpretive constraints of the study. Three components have been especially operative:

\paragraph{(a) The evaluative transformation function \(f(\cdot)\).}
This function encodes the cognitive–affective transformation through which perceptual cues become moral action.  
\textbf{Contribution so far:} it formalises why the presence of a non-interactive robot can affect behaviour despite the absence of communication, directive cues, or explicit social engagement. It embodies the central locus of deformation identified in the hypotheses above.

\paragraph{(b) Expected behavioural distributions \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma)]\) vs.\ \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma \cup \mathscr{R})]\).}
This construct expresses the empirical contrast between the Control and Robot conditions.  
\textbf{Contribution so far:} it provides a principled mathematical representation of the observed attenuation pattern. The behavioural findings align with the inequality
\[
\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma \cup \mathscr{R})] < \mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma)],
\]
thus supporting the retention of the Evaluative Deformation Hypothesis.

\paragraph{(c) The tripartite decomposition}
\[
\mathscr{P}(\delta_m) = f(\alpha_E, \beta_C, \gamma_R).
\]
This expression separates environmental cues (\(\alpha_E\)), dispositional factors (\(\beta_C\)), and robotic presence (\(\gamma_R\)).  
\textbf{Contribution so far:} it justifies the inclusion of psychometric instruments and demographic balance tests. It shows that attenuated prosociality cannot be meaningfully interpreted without jointly considering individual traits and the perturbative effect of robotic presence.

Together, these three formal components ensure that the empirical observations are not treated as purely behavioural regularities but as the surface expressions of a structured evaluative system undergoing controlled perturbation.

\subsection{Interim Conclusion to Question~\ref{q:robot-agent}}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=black!60,title=Partial Conclusion to Question~\ref{q:robot-agent}]
		The behavioural evidence gathered thus far indicates that the silent co-presence of a humanoid robot systematically attenuates prosocial donation, despite the absence of communication, instruction, or interaction. This attenuation supports the plausibility of evaluative deformation: the robot perturbs the inferential transformation from moral salience to moral action. The philosophical hypothesis concerning synthetic normativity explains why such perturbation is possible, while the mechanistic hypothesis concerning moral inference explains how it is instantiated. The role of individual traits, and the deeper structure of trait–context interactions, will be examined in the sections that follow.
	\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

\noindent
In summary, the evidence to this point allows us to affirm that robotic co-presence modifies the evaluative conditions under which morally salient cues become behaviourally actionable. The three retained hypotheses together provide the conceptual, ontological, and mechanistic scaffolding for interpreting this modification. Further analyses will determine how these perturbations scale across heterogeneous psychological profiles and how robust the displacement effect remains under refined statistical scrutiny.

c) this portion also need reallocation- but for some text in it not all of it:


\subsection{Preprocessing the Moral Field: Semiotic Modulation and Ontological Symmetry}

Importantly, the robotic presence $\mathscr{R}$ is not modelled as an agent that exerts influence through interaction or instruction, but as a \textbf{semiotic modulator}: an ontologically ambiguous presence that perturbs the interpretive field in which moral cues operate. Within this framework, the observed attenuation of prosocial behaviour should not be interpreted as a direct suppression of empathy \textit{per se}, but as the result of a structural reconfiguration in what may be called the \textbf{normative encoding schema}: the internal representational system by which moral salience is assigned, weighted, and transmitted within a perceptual environment.

The introduction of $\mathscr{R}$ modifies the topology of this schema, shifting the inferential weight carried by otherwise salient moral signals. The Watching Eye cue, ordinarily a strong generator of prosocial behaviour, is thus refracted through a newly configured semiotic landscape—one in which an embodied but non-agentic entity complicates the attribution of moral relevance and potentially displaces reputational concern.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tables/conditions.pdf}
	\caption{Experimental conditions are behaviorally and procedurally identical, differing only in robotic presence.}
	\label{tab:experimental_conditions}
\end{table}

Both conditions were engineered to be \textbf{epistemically symmetrical}, ensuring that any observed deviation in moral behaviour can be attributed exclusively to the ontological modulation introduced by $\mathscr{R}$. The symmetry is not merely procedural but conceptual: it guarantees that the moral field differs only in the presence or absence of a semiotically potent synthetic form.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tables/variables.pdf}
	\caption{Measured variables and psychometric constructs used in inferential modelling of moral behaviour.}
	\label{tab:key_variables}
\end{table}

This formal and operational framework allows us to treat the experiment as a constrained instantiation of a more general epistemic function: namely, how minimally expressive artificial agents reshape the \textbf{moral topology} of a decision-making environment by altering the interpretive affordances of its cues.

\statementheader{Question}{Ontological Integrity of the Dataset}
\label{question:data_structuring}
\begin{center}
	\begin{questionbox}[label={q:data-prep}]{Data structuring}
		\textbf{What is required of the data at this stage?}  
		How can the raw dataset be transformed into a semantically coherent and mathematically compatible structure—one that preserves the normative architecture of the experiment and enables defensible inferences about moral behaviour?
	\end{questionbox}
\end{center}
Before any inferential operation can be meaningfully performed, the dataset must be rendered analytically legible and ontologically stable. At this foundational stage, our objective was not to extract patterns or test hypotheses, but to establish the \textbf{semantic integrity} and \textbf{computational viability} of the data matrix as a structured representation of moral decision-making. The transformation of moral action into analysable form is itself an epistemic act: the construction of a space in which behaviour can be interrogated without distorting the normative structure from which it emerges.

To this end, a series of principled data transformations were applied:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Variable normalisation}: lowercase conversion and string trimming to eliminate syntactic artefacts and ensure referential transparency.
	\item \textbf{Binary encoding of moral action}: creation of the variable \texttt{donated\_anything}, capturing whether participants donated at all. This enables both continuous and categorical modelling of prosocial behaviour.
	\item \textbf{Numerical encoding of condition}: creation of \texttt{condition\_bin} ($0=\text{Control}$, $1=\text{Robot}$), allowing direct integration into regression-based models.
	\item \textbf{Verification of categorical coherence}: ensuring semantic alignment for fields such as \texttt{gender} and \texttt{group} to eliminate latent structural imbalances.
\end{itemize}

These procedures were not arbitrary conveniences but \textbf{ontological prerequisites}. The dataset comprises scalar, ordinal, and nominal variables, each governed by distinct inferential affordances. Treating them as interchangeable would collapse the analytic structure of the experiment into incoherence, misrepresenting the cognitive architecture it aims to probe.

Importantly, the dataset’s scale (\(N \approx 70\)) allows a rare balance: small enough for manual audit, yet large enough to require principled automation. The transformations performed operate precisely at this interface, upholding both semantic fidelity and computational tractability.

\vspace{0.3cm}

The dataset was then cleaned and preprocessed for inferential modelling. Variable names were standardised, \texttt{donated\_anything} was constructed, and \texttt{condition\_bin} was encoded. Descriptive statistics revealed no major distributional anomalies across demographic or psychometric variables, supporting the assumption of epistemic symmetry between groups and reinforcing the inference that the perturbation introduced by $\mathscr{R}$ operates primarily at the interpretive rather than dispositional level.

Figures~\ref{fig:age_distribution_by_group} and~\ref{fig:donation_distribution_by_condition} visually corroborate this reading: age distributions show no demographic divergence, while donation distributions reveal the predicted attenuation under robotic co-presence. The unified visual palette of the plots maintains stylistic continuity with the thesis’s typographic aesthetic, reinforcing the epistemic unity of the chapter’s representational forms.

\subsection{Interim Evaluation of the Hypotheses and Formal Framework}

\noindent
At this stage, the behavioural and inferential results allow for a provisional assessment of the hypotheses and the formal apparatus introduced earlier. These are not isolated claims, but components of a single explanatory architecture that tracks how moral salience is transformed into observable behaviour under synthetic co-presence.

\noindent
The \textbf{Evaluative Deformation Hypothesis} (Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:evaluative_deformation} p.~\pageref{hyp:evaluative_deformation}) asserts that the expected outcome of moral behaviour, as computed by the evaluative transformation $f$, is altered when the robot is present within the perceptual–moral environment. The chi-squared analysis of aggregate donation totals, together with the bootstrapped mean difference, supports this claim: the pattern
\[
\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma \cup \mathscr{R})] < \mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma)]
\]
is empirically instantiated, albeit modestly and with heterogeneous individual-level expression. This hypothesis is therefore \textbf{retained} as an operative empirical statement about the deformation of group-level moral output under robotic co-presence.

\medskip
\noindent
The \textbf{Synthetic Normativity of Moral Displacement} hypothesis (Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:synthetic_normativity}, p.~\pageref{hyp:synthetic_normativity}) provides the ontological and conceptual groundwork for interpreting this deformation. It claims that synthetic presences, though devoid of sentience, may acquire normative affordances by virtue of their perceived ontology. The present evidence neither confirms nor disconfirms this hypothesis in a narrow statistical sense; rather, it shows that a non-interactive yet semantically rich artefact, \textbf{positioned at the appropriate Level of Abstraction}, can exert measurable influence on prosocial behaviour without issuing commands, arguments, or reasons. This is exactly the pattern one would expect if normative affordances were grounded in informational presentation at a given LoA, rather than in intrinsic moral status. The hypothesis is thus \textbf{retained} as the principal conceptual lens through which the behavioural results are interpreted.

\noindent
The \textbf{Synthetic Perturbation of Moral Inference} hypothesis (Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:synthetic_perturbation},  p.~\pageref{hyp:synthetic_perturbation}) specifies the mechanism connecting the previous two: the robot does not merely co-occur with lowered donations; it perturbs the inferential transition from moral salience to prosocial action by refracting the affective–empathic cues that would otherwise support donation behaviour. The combined pattern of (i) significant aggregate attenuation, (ii) overlapping individual-level distributions, and (iii) non-trivial yet fragile effect sizes is coherent with this mechanistic reading: the evaluative mapping is not destroyed, but \textbf{its topology is altered}. This hypothesis is therefore \textbf{retained} as a working account of how the deformation is instantiated at the level of moral inference.
\noindent
In sum, all three hypotheses remain live and mutually reinforcing:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:evaluative_deformation}, (p.~\pageref{hyp:evaluative_deformation}) identifies the \emph{empirical signature} of deformation at the level of expected behaviour.
	\item Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:synthetic_normativity}, (p.~\pageref{hyp:synthetic_normativity}) explains the \emph{ontological possibility} of such deformation within Floridi’s informationalist framework and its Levels of Abstraction.
	\item Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:synthetic_perturbation}, (p.~\pageref{hyp:synthetic_perturbation}) articulates the \emph{inferential pathway} through which robotic presence reshapes the transition from moral salience to action.
\end{itemize}

No hypothesis introduced thus far is contradicted by the current evidence; rather, the data suggest that the deformation is subtle, probabilistic, and mediated—exactly the kind of effect one would expect when perturbation occurs at the level of semantic encoding rather than at the level of explicit instruction or coercion.
