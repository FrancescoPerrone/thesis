# Prima domanda sperimentale
Can the mere presence of a synthetic, non-agentic entity deform the inferential 
substrate through which moral action is generated?

# Domanda ampia:
does the inclusion of a synthetic co-presence (\(\mathscr{R}\)) within a 
morality-salient perceptual space (\(\Sigma\)) alter the expected outcome of the 
evaluative transformation function \(f(\cdot)\), such that the distribution of moral 
behaviour \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma \cup \mathscr{R})]\) diverges from \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma)]\)? 
Here, \(\Sigma\) includes affective moral cues (e.g., the Watching Eye),
while \(\delta_m\) is instantiated behaviourally as charitable donation.

# Prima ipotesi:
Titolo: Synthetic Normativity - Moral Displacement Hypothesis
Ipotesi: Synthetic presences, though devoid of sentience, may acquire normative 
affordances by virtue of their perceived ontology.

### Passaggio piu' importante del capitolo
What this study observes, therefore, is not simply what participants do under 
(staged) robotic observation, but how the inferential architecture of moral cognition
is perturbed by synthetic presence. The robot, though devoid of agency, functions as
a semiotic operator on the moral field—its presence refracts the salience of  
otherwise normative cues, modulating prosocial output through shifts in 
interpretive topology. We do not treat generosity as a readout of innate 
disposition, but as the \textit{emergent property of norm-sensitive evaluative 
systems embedded in structured environments}.
