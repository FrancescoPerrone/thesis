# Prima domanda sperimentale
Can the mere presence of a synthetic, non-agentic entity deform the inferential substrate through which moral action is generated?
# Domanda ampia:
does the inclusion of a synthetic co-presence (\(\mathscr{R}\)) within a morality-salient perceptual space (\(\Sigma\)) alter the expected outcome of the evaluative transformation function \(f(\cdot)\), such that the distribution of moral behaviour \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma \cup \mathscr{R})]\) diverges from \(\mathbb{E}[f(\Sigma)]\)? Here, \(\Sigma\) includes affective moral cues (e.g., the Watching Eye), while \(\delta_m\) is instantiated behaviourally as charitable donation.

# Prima ipotesi:
Titolo: Synthetic Normativity - Moral Displacement Hypothesis
Ipotesi: Synthetic presences, though devoid of sentience, may acquire normative affordances by virtue of their perceived ontology.
