\chapter{Declaration}

\noindent
I declare that, with the exception of background sections that review existing literature and established theoretical frameworks (chapters~\ref{chap:lit_rev}, \ref{chap:tools}, and part of chapter~\ref{chap:general_discussion}) all original research presented in this thesis---including the experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis, clustering procedures, and the development of the evaluative--topological model of moral perturbation---was carried out independently by the author, unless otherwise explicitly stated.  
All sources have been appropriately acknowledged, and no part of this thesis has been submitted for any other degree or qualification.
