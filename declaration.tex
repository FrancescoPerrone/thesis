\chapter{Declaration}

\noindent
I confirm that I am the sole author of this thesis. With the exception of
background sections that review existing literature and established theoretical
frameworks (chapters~\ref{chap:lit_rev}, \ref{chap:tools_new}, and the
non-original contextual material in chapters~\ref{chap:moral_primer} and
\ref{chap:general_discussion}), all research reported here is my own independent
work.

This includes the conception and design of the experiment, all data collection
and preprocessing, the statistical and clustering analyses, and the development
of the evaluative--topological framework used throughout the thesis, except
where explicit acknowledgements are provided.

All sources have been appropriately cited, and no part of this thesis has been
submitted for any other degree or qualification.
