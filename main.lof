\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5.4}{\ignorespaces Mean donation amounts by experimental condition, with 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Participants in the Control condition donated more on average than those in the Robot condition, aligning with the hypothesis that robotic presence attenuates the inferential mapping from moral salience to prosocial action.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5.5}{\ignorespaces Kernel density estimates of donation distributions across conditions. The Control group exhibits higher central mass and a heavier rightward extension relative to the Robot group, consistent with a directional attenuation of high-value prosocial acts in the presence of the synthetic co-presence $\mathscr {R}$.\relax }}{100}{figure.caption.35}%

The Control group donates more on average (£1.89) than the Robot group (£1.17), corroborating the hypothesis that robotic presence modulates—rather than eliminates—the evaluative pathway from moral salience to action.\relax }}{101}{figure.caption.36}%

Each panel displays individual participant scores alongside a smoothed linear trend.

Error bars represent standard deviation. Cluster 1 shows a marked attenuation of donation under robotic presence, whereas Clusters 0 and 2 exhibit minimal or modest differences.

The density skews toward negative values, indicating directional probabilistic evidence that robotic co-presence attenuates prosocial behaviour. The vertical dashed line denotes the point of no effect.
