# Thesis teporary notes

### General

We need to check all lists now and make sure that all style in experiment opening was applied to all lists in the thesis.

### Abstract

- [ ] re-draft abstract to make it slightly shorter and consider this passage:

```text
The proximal object of measurement in the experiment is moral behaviour in the presence of a robot — specifically, behaviour in a prosocial donation task under Watching–Eye cues, with or without NAO’s silent presence.

That is the empirical focus.
```

```md
From Chapter 3 onwards, you explicitly position the thesis within a different explanatory layer:

- Moral behaviour is not the endpoint of rules or reasoning. It is the endpoint of movement in an evaluative field shaped by salience, affect, accountability, and attention.

- Robots do not “change decisions” directly; they reshape the evaluative conditions in which decisions form.

Thus, the theoretical object of study is:

how synthetic presence perturbs the evaluative topology upstream of deliberation.

This is not metaphorical.
It is your reduction base: the set of variables, mechanisms, and structural relations that actually generate behaviour.
```

### Chapert 2

* [ ] Maybe we need to take down these line of references: 

```latex
~\cite{Doris2015,Greene2014,SinnottArmstrong2008,Malle2016}
```

* [ ] The whole discussion on LLM could be reduce a lot.
* [ ] Replace "literature review" in the title.
* [ ] here could go the definition of evaluative field. Search for it it has a subsection.

### Chapter 3

* [ ] the main contribution os a working definition of Moral cognition
* [ ] Do we actually need the distinction between factual and normative judgments?
* [ ] From around page 45 make sure all acronimi have been introduced or it would be shit!
* [ ] 3.4.1 could be deleted. If it stays it needs to be checked and improved.

### Chapter 4

* [ ] consider this title instead:

```text
From Theory to Measurement: Instruments for Modelling Dispositions and Perturbation
```

* [ ] boubleckeck conclusion

### Bibliography

* [ ] Need to check there are not repeated entries in the list (at least not evidently repeated)
