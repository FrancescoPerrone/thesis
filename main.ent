alone
on
Google
Scholar
yielded
an
astonishing
number
of
more
than
39,000
results
as
of
October
2021.
However,
as
of
today,
this

has
significantly
grown
to
about
86,200

indicating
a
substantial
increase
in
literature
on
the
subject
over
the
past
year.
Furthermore,
a
search
for
the

on
Google
Scholar
produced
an
already
staggering
number
of
approximately
3,000,000

as
of
October
2021.
However,
the
figure
has
seen
a
remarkable
growth,
now
standing

emphasising
the
continued
expansion
of
research
and
scholarly
engagement
with
the
ethical
aspects
of
artificial
intelligence.
These
notable
increases
and
changes
in
the
figures
for
both
'Computational
Morality'
and
'Machine
Ethics'
highlight
the
growing
prominence
and
visibility
of
these
fields
within
the
academic
community.
They
signify
the
escalating
interest
among
researchers,
scholars,
and
ethicists
in
investigating
the
ethical
dimensions
of
computational
systems
and
the
moral
implications
of
their
actions
\textit
{at
the
least}.
The
significant
growth
in
literature
not
only
reflects
a
broader
understanding
of
the
ethical
challenges
posed
by
advancing
technologies
but
also
underscores
the
pressing
need
to
address
and
discuss
the
ethical
considerations
associated
with
the
design,
deployment,
and
impact
of
computational
systems
in
our
society.
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
figures
provided
here
are
based
on
a
search
conducted
on

Due
to
the
dynamic
nature
of
online
databases,
the
exact
figures
may
vary
over
time.
Nonetheless,
the
substantial
increase
in
publications
on
computational
morality
and
machine
ethics
signifies
the
continuous
expansion
and
significance
of
these
fields
in
the
realm
of
ethical
inquiry.
The
rapid
growth
of
research
in
the
field
of
computational
morality
and
machine
ethics
highlights
its
paramount
importance
in
our
increasingly
technologically-driven
world.
As
computational
systems
and
artificial
intelligence
become
more
integrated
into
various
aspects
of
society,
it
is
crucial
to
explore
the
ethical
implications
of
their
actions
[\textbf
{we

Understanding
and
addressing
the
moral
dimensions
of
these
systems
is
vital
to
ensure
their
responsible
development,
deployment,
and
impact
on
individuals
and
communities.
The
remarkable
expansion
of
literature
in
computational
morality
is
a
testament
to
the
urgency
and
significance
of
this
research
area.
In
fact,
the
rate
of
growth
in
this
field
often
surpasses
that
of
many
other
scientific
and
computer
science-related
disciplines,
illustrating
the
heightened
attention
and
recognition
it
receives.
This
exponential
rise
underscores
the
interdisciplinary
nature
of
computational
morality,
drawing
insights
from
philosophy,
computer
science,
sociology,
and
other
fields.
It
highlights
the
recognition
among
scholars,
researchers,
and
practitioners
that
the
ethical
considerations
and
social
implications
of
computational
systems
are
integral
to
the
advancement
of
technology
and
the
well-being
of
society
as
a
whole.
By
delving
into
computational
morality,
we
pave
the
way
for
a
future
in
which
ethical
principles
guide
the
design,
implementation,
and
use
of
intelligent
systems,
ensuring
that
they
align
with
human
values
and
promote
the
greater
good.
